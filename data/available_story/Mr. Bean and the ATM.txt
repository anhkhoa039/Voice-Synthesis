Mr. Bean goes to the bank to withdraw money. He steps up to the ATM, carefully pulls out his card, and enters his PIN. But instead of pressing the right buttons, he gets distracted by a bird sitting nearby.

The bird suddenly flies onto the ATM screen, and Bean shoos it away—accidentally hitting the wrong buttons. His ATM spits out a ridiculously large amount of cash, which the wind blows everywhere. Bean scrambles to collect the bills, stuffing them into his pockets, shoes, and even his teddy bear.

Just as he finishes gathering the money, the bank guard approaches. Panicking, Bean pretends he’s an ATM technician, stuffing himself into the ATM’s slot to “fix” it. The guard shakes his head and walks away, leaving Bean stuck inside the machine, peeking out comically as a new customer arrives.
