Once upon a time, there lived a poor boy named Aladdin with his mother. One day, a suspicious merchant comes up to Aladdin’s mother and says he will make them rich if she sends Aladdin with him. After covering some distance, the magician disguised as a merchant took some powder from his pocket, threw it, and a cave appeared. He asked Aladdin to get inside the cave and get a lamp for him.

In the cave, there were gold and all kind of treasures. Among those was a magic lamp that was dirty. Aladdin took the lamp and asked the magician to fetch him out first. The angry wizard closed the cave door with a rock and went away. Aladdin was struck inside the cave and started cleaning the lamp, and a genie appeared. Genie asked Aladdin to make a wish, and Aladdin asked him to take him home.

Back home, Aladdin rubbed the lamp again and asked the genie for a palace. Genie granted him his wish, and now Aladdin has become the richest man in the city. He got married to the princess. The evil magician who heard all of this went to the princess, acting like an old merchant and exchanged the magical lamp with a regular lamp and ran away.

The magician rubbed the lamp and made his wish. He asked the genie to send Aladdin’s palace far away in the desert. Aladdin had a ring that the magician gave him long back. He gently rubbed the ring, and another genie appeared. He was immediately taken to that place and saw the magician there. He quickly grabbed the lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared and asked Aladdin for his wish. Aladdin commanded the genie to take the evil magician far away, never to be found again.

Aladdin rescued the princess and his mother, and they lived happily ever after in the palace.
