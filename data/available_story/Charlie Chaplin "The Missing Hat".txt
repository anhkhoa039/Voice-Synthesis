Charlie, dressed in his iconic baggy suit and bowler hat, is walking down a busy street when a strong gust of wind blows his hat off. The hat lands on a cart filled with fish. Determined to retrieve it, Charlie leaps onto the cart, but as he grabs the hat, the cart starts rolling downhill.

Charlie clings on, trying to stop the cart, but it crashes into a fruit stand, sending apples flying everywhere. To avoid the angry fruit vendor, Charlie grabs a basket of apples to “help,” only to trip over a stray dog. The apples spill onto the street, and the crowd erupts in laughter.

Finally, Charlie puts on his hat triumphantly, only to realize it’s a fish instead of his hat. He shrugs, tips the “fish hat” to the crowd, and waddles off as everyone claps at his accidental performance.
