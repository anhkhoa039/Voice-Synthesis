Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Thomas Edison who loved to ask questions. He was curious about everything around him and always wanted to know how things worked. However, Thomas wasn’t like the other kids at school. He had trouble learning the way his teachers wanted him to and often got distracted because his mind was full of ideas.

One day, his teacher got frustrated and told Thomas’s mother that he was “too slow to learn.” Instead of giving up on her son, Thomas’s mother believed in him. She decided to teach him at home. Thomas thrived under her care, reading every book he could find and performing little experiments in the basement.

As he grew up, Thomas faced many challenges, but his love for inventing kept him going. He experimented thousands of times to create the light bulb but failed repeatedly. People laughed at him and told him to give up.

But Thomas didn’t see failure as defeat. He famously said, "I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work." He kept learning from his mistakes and eventually succeeded, inventing the first practical electric light bulb.

Because of his perseverance, Thomas Edison didn’t just create the light bulb—he also invented the phonograph, motion picture cameras, and many more devices that changed the world forever.
